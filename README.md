# reviewwagon

Reviewagon is a baby stroller reviews app. This application allows the user to read previous reviews from other users, create their own review, rate the stroller on a five-start system, edit their review and delete the review if they no longer want it show on the app. Now that I am a father of two, a stroller is more important than ever because we need a stroller that works for both kids and is light enough that my wife can handle it when I am not around. The first time we purchased a stroller we search tons of websites reading the reviews of  what seem like a million baby strollers. It would have been super helpful if there was one central location where I can read reviews on one site and make my decision from there. That is where reviewagon comes into play, your safe place in an unsafe world to share your stroller experiences
